# OverTheWire wargames

This is we're I'll write down the solutions I've came up with for the wargames hosted on OverTheWire.org. I decided to do this out of nostalgia for the website that taught me the basics in the Linux operating system and skills I use every day like Bash scripting and the git command line interface.

I know it's against the rules to post solutions to the games but this is a work of love, not malice. If you'd like me to take this repo down please DM me and I'll be happy to oblige.
