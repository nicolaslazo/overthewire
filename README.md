# OverTheWire wargames

This is we're I'll write down the solutions I've came up with for the wargames hosted on OverTheWire.org. The idea is to show my skills working with different command line tools like Bash scripting and the git CLI and my knowledge of the Linux operating system.

I know it's against the rules to post solutions to the games but this is a work of love, not malice. If you'd like me to take this repo down please DM me and I'll be happy to oblige.
