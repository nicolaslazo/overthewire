# Level 22

> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22 
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

Checking the script mentioned in the crontab, it seems like they're writing the password to a file in /tmp

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh 
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

Cat that file and proceed to the next level.
