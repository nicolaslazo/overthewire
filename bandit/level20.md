# Level 20

> To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

Only bandit20 can access the password file for the next level, so this script is our way in
```./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20```
