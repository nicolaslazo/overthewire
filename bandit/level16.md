`netcat` wouldnt work here, so I googled "netcat with SSL" and found [this very helpful thread](https://serverfault.com/questions/102032/connecting-to-https-with-netcat-nc) that showed the basic syntax for SSL suggestion. The command wouldn't work like that so I had to add `-ign_eof` like suggested.
`echo BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign_eof`
