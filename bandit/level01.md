# Level 1

> The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

Use `cat readme` to get the new password, copy it and log into the server like you did in level 0 using `bandit1` as the username.
